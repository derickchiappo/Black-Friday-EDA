# Black-Friday-EDA


This repository has my exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Black Friday Sales dataset from Kaggle. 

This analysis includes the following:

Identification of features with missing values and replacement of the missing values 
Identification of unique values in each feature
Description of the distribution and central tenedecies of the features
Stratification of the data by demographic data (e.g. gender, city, occupation).
